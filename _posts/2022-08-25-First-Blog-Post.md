## This is my first blog post

**What do you think being a data scientist is about?** 

Being a data scientist is about truly understanding the data you are responsible for, and being able to derive business-critical insights from that data.
The way those insights are found are dependent on the type of project - they may require simple data analysis using statistical techniques or creating
a machine learning model.

**What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?**  
The major duties of a data scientist include being able to pull data from one or more data sources, being able to combine that data, explore it and understand it. Then the data scientist should be able to analyze the data and determine the best course of action to generate insights. An important knowledge area for a data scientist is coding, primarily Python or R as well as SQL. Another knowledge area is statistics and advanced math, so that the data scientist can understand what is going on behind the scenes for the machine learning algorithms they may be employing. Data visualization and storytelling is also a key knowledge area - being able to tell the story of the data in a way that generates buy-in from stakeholders is crucial.

**What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?**  
Both data scientists and statisticians need to have a solid understanding of statistics. They both need to have the ability to understand the data they are working with. A big difference between the two is the complexity of machine learning models applied to problems - typically, data scientists work with more complex ML models such as neural networks. The added complexity means that data scientists are typically stronger from a programming perspective. Statisticians need to be stronger in stats than data scientists - data scientists don't necessarily need to understand all of the complicated theoretical statistics. 


**How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?**
I view myself as a data scientist - both because that has been my job title in the past and because I identify more strongly with the ability to pull and deal with large data sets than my ability to understand the statistics behind the algorithms I use everyday. That's why I'm in this program - to get better fundamentals so I can make better decisions with regards to the ML algorithms I'm using. In addition, I work in the hiring space, so I need to be very aware of any potential bias in the data and how that can show up in the algorithm. Having a stronger background in statistics will allow me to identify when there are bias issues, how they are arising, and how I can modify the algorithm to reduce the bias.
