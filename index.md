### Purpose of this blog  

This is the hub for all my blog posts for ST558, a class from NCSU Master's
of Statistics program. The class is focused on R but I'll be blogging about things
related to R as well as the data space!

### About me  

My name is Annie Brinza. I am currently the Manager of Data Science and Data
Engineering at Wonderlic, working on reducing bias in the hiring space. I've been
in the data space for five years now, and here are all the titles I've held:
1. Data Analyst
2. Senior Data Analyst
3. Data Scientist
4. Machine Learning Engineer
5. Manager of Data Science and Data Engineering

I'm currently located in Charlotte, NC. I think we have one of the prettiest
skylines of all the cities I've been to.
